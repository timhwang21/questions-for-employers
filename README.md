# Post-interview questions

## Introduction

You don't need to pretend to interviewers that you're reciting everything from memory because you're so knowledgeable of what questions are good to ask. "I have a bunch of questions here, so I'll go down the list and you can stop me when you have to go."

## To one interviewer

* What is your stack? What parts are new? Are you thinking of adding to it?
  * How are choices of tech / vendor / etc. made?
